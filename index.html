          <h2>Evacuation Hack: Emergency Restoration</h2>
          <p>
            When a major storm or hurricane is on the horizon, it is always best
            to follow evacuation order if your country authorities advice you to
            do so. While following basic tips like placing your valuables high
            that you cannot take with you and securing patio furniture, did you
            ever think of your refrigerator?
          </p>
          <p>Is the food safe when you return?</p>
          <p>
            If the electric goes out, the contents of a freezer can completely
            thaw out spoiling all of your groceries.
          </p>
          <p>
            There may even be enough time for this spoiled food to completely
            refreeze again making it hard to tell if your freezer and
            refrigerated items are safe for consumption. How will you know?
          </p>

          <h2>Evacuation Tip!</h2>
          <p>
            Next time, while packing and preparing for the evacuation, freeze a
            cup of water. After the the water is frozen, place a quarter on the
            top of the water and put it back into the freezer.
          </p>
          <p>
            After returning home from the evacuation, if you find the quarter
            has moved to the bottom of the cup, then you'll know your power was
            out long enough to unthaw your frozen goods. This food should be
            thrown away.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you find your quarter in the middle, you know the power did go
            out, but not long enough to completely thaw the cup of water. Use
            your own discretion for discarding food if this is the case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is the quarter still on top? That means your freezer's contents
            stayed frozen the entire time. All of your refrigerated goods are
            safe for consumption!
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember to always follow authority guidelines for returning back to
            your home or business during an evacuation. If you've experienced
            any damage to your business, multi-family property, or campus.
