          <h2>Evacuation Hack: Emergency Restoration</h2>
          <p>
            When a major storm or hurricane is on the horizon, it is always best
            to follow evacuation order if your country authorities advice you to
            do so. While following basic tips like placing your valuables high
            that you cannot take with you and securing patio furniture, did you
            ever think of your refrigerator?
          </p>
          <p>Is the food safe when you return?</p>
          <p>
            If the electric goes out, the contents of a freezer can completely
            thaw out spoiling all of your groceries.
          </p>
          <p>
            There may even be enough time for this spoiled food to completely
            refreeze again making it hard to tell if your freezer and
            refrigerated items are safe for consumption. How will you know?
